You can either be trainer or trainee 

You can either be trainer or trainee

If you are logged as trainee you can join classes, calculate your calories and choose your trainer. You can join with membership,see when it ends and what training program to follow. You can also see what eating plans and exercises you have.

If you're logged as trainer you can see how many clients have chosen you for their trainer and you can communicate with them via chat or messages. You can give trainings and meal plans for each trainee to follow. 

When you are logged you will have a profile drop-down menu options. 

Classes are visualized and every class has collection of trainers which the user can assign to.

You can register with Facebook and immediately you will be asked to fill age, weight, goal and height.
