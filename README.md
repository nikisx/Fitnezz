You can either be trainer or trainee 

If you are logged as trainee you can join classes,calculate your calories and choose your trainer. You can join with membership and see when it ends and see what training program to follow. You can see also what eating plans you have and what exercises 

If you're logged as trainer you can see how many clients have chosen you for their trainer
You can communicate with them via chat or messages and for each you can give training to follow and a meal plan.
